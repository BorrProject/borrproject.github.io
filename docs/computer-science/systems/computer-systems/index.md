## Computer Systems (Reccommended)
*Timeline: 40-60 hours*

This course acts as a stand-in for CS-354: Intro to Computer Systems taught at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which acts as an introduction to real-world computer systems. This course is not strictly required for students who wish to do the base approach to OSTEP, however, it is highly recommended, as it gives valuable insight into how to program for real hardware. For the extended approach, this course is **strictly required**.

The course covers 3 main topics:
- Intro to C
- Machine Programming with x86
- The Memory Hierarchy

The primary textbook for this course is [Dive into Systems](https://diveintosystems.org/book/) with selected lectures from [CMU 15-213](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15213-f15/www/index.html) and labs from [CS:APP](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/). You do not need the CS:APP textbook to complete these labs. The readings are assigned as whole chapters. This means that when you are assigned eg. chapter 1 as a reading, you should read the chapter introduction *as well as* sections 1.1 through 1.8. Remember to do the exercises after each chapter.

### Additional Resources

* [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, Third Edition](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/)  
  This most excellent textbook provides a thorough introduction to the topic of systems programming. Besides covering all material encountered in this course, it also covers additional material such as virtual memory, system level I/O, basic networking and concurrency in C. If you're serious about systems-level programming, this book is a must-have. Beware that the Global Edition is riddled with errors in its exercises and solutions. This edition is **not** recommended.

#### C

* [CS 50 Manual Pages](https://manual.cs50.io): a great reference for looking up C library functions; most functions include both the usual manual as well as a beginner-friendly "less comfortable" option (just note that the "less comfortable" version uses `string` as an alias for `char *`.)
* [cdecl](https://cdecl.org): a tool to translate C gibberish into English.
* [Secure Coding Practices in C and C++](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321822137): if you want to understand why other C resources are so unsafe.
* [*The C Programming Language*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0131103628): the original book on C by its creators. 

#### Assembly
* [CPU Registers x86](https://wiki.osdev.org/CPU_Registers_x86): good for looking up specific registers.
* [*PC Assembly Language*](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/readings/pcasm-book.pdf): a short book on x86 assembly.
* [GCC Inline Assembly HOWTO](https://www.ibiblio.org/gferg/ldp/GCC-Inline-Assembly-HOWTO.html): a guide to writing assembly code inside a C program.
* [*Intel 80386 Programmer's Reference Manual*](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2018/readings/i386.pdf): the official (and huge) resourcefrom Intel.
