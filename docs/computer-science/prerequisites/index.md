# Prerequisites & Motivation
*Timeline: 0 - 2 years*

There are a few prerequisites to be aware of before starting your Computer Science studies at The Borr Project.

First of all, if you do not have a strong mathematical foundation from Arithmetic to Precalculus, you will need to go through the Pre-College Math curriculum before starting the Computer Science curriculum at The Borr Project.

Don't feel like you need to start completely from scratch as we provide diagnostic tests to determine what you need to study to be sufficiently prepared for CS.

- [Pre-College Math](/precollege-math/index.md), 0 - 2 years

Secondly, there is the mental aspect of self-study. Are you prepared to commit to a routine of studying Computer Science regularly for a few years? This is a challenge for everyone, but rest assured we have resources designed to help. Be sure to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/uR2QS36pdH) server for cohort meetings, progress sharing, tutoring, and an overall passionate community to hang out & study with. Check out [Getting Help](/getting-help.md) before asking questions. Another good read is [How to Ask Technical Questions](https://www.theodinproject.com/guides/community/how_to_ask) by The Odin Project; these tips can help you anywhere.

Here are a few courses that some may find helpful to get the right mindset necessary for self study. They are both optional, but past students have mentioned that they have been helpful.

- [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn), 14 hrs
- [Mindshift](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindshift), 9 hrs

Finally, if you feel like the prerequisites are too daunting, feel free to break up your math studies with some basic programming. The following course is completely optional, but it can break up the monotony of exclusively studying high school math.

- [Elementary Programming](elementary-programming/), 75 - 100 hrs

Once you're ready, feel free to start the [Intro Computer Science](../intro-cs/index.md) track to get an idea of what CS is all about. Afterwards, complete the [Program Design](../program-design/index.md) and [Math](../math/index.md) track in any order. Once both of those are done, you can do any of the other tracks any time.
