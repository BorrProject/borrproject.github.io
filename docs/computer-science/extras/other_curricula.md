# Other curricula

The Borr Prject is one of a few efforts to inform learners how they can pursue computer science independently. Below are a few other such efforts.

- [OSSU](https://cs.ossu.dev/)
- [Google - Guide for Technical Development](https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/guide-to-technical-development.html)
- [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)
- [Obtaining a Thorough CS Background Online](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/05/15/obtaining-thorough-cs-background-online/)
- [P1xt](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides)
- [Functional CS](https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/)

What differentiates the Borr Project? The Borr Project is dedicated to how an individual can learn the undergraduate CS curriculum. This is why we use the [CS2013](../../curricular_guidelines) as our curricular guidelines. These guidelines are written by the two foremost professional organizations in computing.

To know what makes the Borr Project Different from OSSU, read [this blog post](https://borrproject.github.io/blog/announcing-borr-project/).

This approach has the benefit of clarifying to others the extent of a student's study and understanding. Students have gone from the Borr Project (and its predecessor OSSU) study into both tech industry employment and into Computer Science graduate school. We look forward to helping you do the same.
