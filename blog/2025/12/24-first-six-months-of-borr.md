BORR Project started out as a community fork of OSSU to rebuild the community where people can come together, geek out, and support one another in a peer learning environment for computer science and math. Six months in, we’re excited to share our progress.

### Repos & Discord Community

- We launched a new Docusaurus-based website. Compared to a GitHub README, it offers a significantly better user experience and allows us to organize supplementary information without clutter. Recent additions include progress tracking (inspired by The Odin Project) and global search.
- Our Discord server leverages new community features like onboarding, forums, event channels, and AutoMod. We also recently activated our server tag.
- Despite having only 83 members (at the time of writing), we observed **13% more activity** in public channels over the last 5 months compared to the OSSU server.
- We held active cohort meetings with consistent participation and organized a server event around the CodinGame Summer Challenge.

### Curriculum

- We promptly addressed issues with courses affected by Coursera's removal of the audit option by identifying alternative resources.
- We have seen familiar and new faces contributing to our repos, streamlining resource suggestions and fixes. The Preschool Math curriculum, for instance, received a complete overhaul.
- We avoid a strict "lecture-only" policy, embracing books, articles, and other formats. For example, we recommend [CS:APP](/computer-science/systems/computer-systems/#computer-systems-recommended) before students start [OSTEP](/computer-science/systems/ostep). We provide supplementary notes on how these texts complement each other in the systems programming section to help students plan their studies effectively.
- The curriculum is actively maintained with frequent contributions on GitHub regarding courses, issues, and research suggestions. We've also added supplemental resources to many courses.

## Roadmap for the Next 6 Months

Beyond gathering user feedback and adapting to community needs, our key goals for the next half-year include:

- Developing comprehensive "Setting Up Your Development Environment" guides, inspired by The Odin Project.
- Creating a showcase board for students to share their curriculum work and projects.
- Hosting more server events and group activities.
- Formalizing a governance structure that is open and collaborative.
- Organizing focus groups (tutors, website maintainers, curriculum maintainers, etc.) and assigning roles.
- And marketing! We plan to announce the Borr Project on Reddit, Hacker News, and the wider internet to acquire more users.

Join us in building a place where we can all geek out and learn together!
