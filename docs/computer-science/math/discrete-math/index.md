# Discrete Math
Timeline: 65 hours - 1 year

Covers everything typically found in a Discrete Math course.
- [Mathematics for Computer Science 2019](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:OCW+6.042J+2T2019/about), 65 hrs
- Alternative: [Mathematics for Computer Science 2010](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/)

Many students choose to go with a paid textbook for easier introduction to this subject:
- [Discrete Mathematics with Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Susanna-Epp/dp/1337694193/), 1 year

This book covers some topics which are covered again in [theory courses](/computer-science/theory/index.md). The MIT course and the corresponding book covers more topics, which are not covered by this book.


[Book of Proof](https://richardhammack.github.io/BookOfProof/) can be used as a quick introduction to writing proofs.
