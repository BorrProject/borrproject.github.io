## A Community-Driven Evolution of OSSU

For years, the Open-Source Society University (OSSU) Computer Science curriculum has been an invaluable resource, positively impacting countless lives. It fostered a vibrant community, rich with industry professionals, academics, and engaged students who collaborated and learned together. However, over time, the OSSU community has faced challenges, leading to a decline in collaboration and engagement. Many of the individuals who contributed significantly to its strength have moved on, and the current administrative structure has introduced friction and delays.

We believe in the power of open education and the strength of a truly collaborative community. That's why we, a group of former OSSU staff members and active community contributors, are excited to announce the **Borr Project**â€”a fork designed to revitalize and advance the OSSU computer science curriculum, both academically and as a community.

## Our Vision for Borr Project

The core of Borr Project's vision is a commitment to **decentralized, collaborative leadership**. Unlike the current single-director model, Borr Project will adopt an open-source governance structure, drawing inspiration from other successful projects. This means:

- **Community-led Development**: Decisions and initiatives will be driven by the community, fostering a more responsive and agile environment.
- **Reduced Bureaucracy**: We aim to minimize unnecessary processes, empowering contributors to implement meaningful changes efficiently.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: We will actively cultivate an environment where new ideas can flourish and diverse contributions are welcomed and encouraged.

## Moving Forward: Key Initiatives and Future Plans

Our immediate focus for Borr Project includes a number of key initiatives to improve the learning experience and rebuild a thriving community:

- **Revitalized Online Presence**: We're developing a proper, user-friendly website using Docusaurus, featuring improved SEO and accessibility, to make the curriculum more discoverable and navigable.
- **Richer Learning Resources**:
  - Creating video content showcasing projects built throughout the curriculum.
    - Expanding and refining course pages for greater clarity and depth.
    - Developing comprehensive "Setting Up Your Development Environment" guides, similar to The Odin Project's excellent resources.
    - Adding extra practice problems with automated checks (e.g., using check50) for a more interactive learning experience.
- **Rebuilding Community Engagement**: We're excited to re-introduce and expand community initiatives that were previously difficult to implement, such as:
  - Regular online community meet-ups and events.
    - Collaborative projects and study groups.
    - Mentorship opportunities and avenues for peer support.

These are just a few of the many ideas our collective of former OSSU staff and contributors are eager to bring to life. We believe in empowering the community to shape the future of open-source computer science education.

## Our Commitment

Before embarking on this new path, we, as former staff, did raise our concerns regarding the direction and administrative structure of OSSU with its leadership. Ultimately, these discussions did not lead to the necessary changes. With no active moderators currently present in the OSSU community, we, the former staff who remain committed to the original spirit of open-source education, have come together to establish Borr Project.

We invite all former OSSU community members, new learners, and anyone passionate about accessible, high-quality computer science education to join us. The Borr Project is a fresh start, built on the principles of collaboration, innovation, and community empowerment.

Stay tuned for updates as we build Borr Project together!
