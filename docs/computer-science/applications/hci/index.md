# User Interface Design & Implementation
*Timeline: 150-200 hours*

- [User Interface Design & Implementation](https://web.mit.edu/6.813/www/sp18/)

This course introduces principles of user interface development, focusing on the following areas:

- Design. We will look at how to design good user interfaces, covering important design principles (consistency, visibility, simplicity, efficiency, and graphic design) and the human capabilities that motivate them (including perception, motor skills, color vision, attention, and human error).
- Implementation. We will see techniques for building user interfaces, including low-fidelity prototyping, input, output, model-view-controller, and layout.
- Evaluation. We will learn techniques for evaluating and measuring interface usability, including heuristic evaluation, predictive evaluation, and user testing.
