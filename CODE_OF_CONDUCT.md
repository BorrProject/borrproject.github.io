Thank you for being a part of the Borr project. We value your participation and want everyone to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all participants are expected to follow this Code of Conduct, and to show respect, understanding, and consideration to one another. Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly community for everyone.

# Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all the Borr project community spaces, including, but not limited to:
- This server
- The GitHub organization

Communication channels and private conversations that are normally out of scope may be considered in scope if a Borr Project participant is being stalked or harassed. Social media conversations may be considered in-scope if the incident occurred under a Borr Project related hashtag, or when an official Borr Project account on social media is tagged, or within any other discussion about the Borr Project. The Borr Project reserves the right to take actions against behaviors that happen in any context, if they are deemed to be relevant to the Borr project and its participants.

All participants in the Borr Project community spaces are subject to the Code of Conduct. This includes the Borr Project admins and GitHub Organization Owners. This also includes volunteers, maintainers, leaders, contributors, contribution reviewers, issue reporters, server members, and anyone participating in discussion in the Borr project community spaces.

# Reporting an Incident

If you believe that someone is violating the Code of Conduct, or have any other concerns, please contact the moderators in private threads in the [discord server](https://discord.gg/uR2QS36pdH) or by sending a message to modmail bot.

## Community Guidelines

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Be friendly.** Use welcoming and inclusive language.
- **Be empathetic.** Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- **Be respectful.** When we disagree, we do so in a polite and constructive manner.
- **Be considerate.** Remember that decisions are often a difficult choice between competing priorities. Focus on what is best for the community. Keep discussions around technology choices constructive and respectful.
- **Be patient and generous.** If someone asks for help it is because they need it. When documentation is available that answers the question, politely point them to it. If the question is off-topic, suggest a more appropriate online space to seek help.
- **Try to be concise.** Read the discussion before commenting in order to not repeat a point that has been made.

## Inappropriate Behavior

Community members asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately.

We want all participants in the Borr Project community have the best possible experience they can. In order to be clear what that means, we’ve provided a list of examples of behaviors that are inappropriate for the Borr Project community spaces:

- **Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.**
- **Sustained disruption of online discussion, talks, or other events**. Sustained disruption of events, online discussions, or meetings, including talks and presentations, will not be tolerated. This includes ‘Talking over’ or ‘heckling’ event speakers or influencing crowd actions that cause hostility in event sessions. Sustained disruption also includes drinking alcohol to excess or using recreational drugs to excess, or pushing others to do so.
- **Harassment of people who don’t drink alcohol or other legal substances.** We do not tolerate derogatory comments about those who abstain from alcohol or other legal substances. We do not tolerate pushing people to drink, talking about their abstinence or preferences to others, or pressuring them to drink – physically or through jeering.

### Safety versus Comfort

The GNOME community prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort, for example in situations involving:

- “Reverse”-isms, including “reverse racism,” “reverse sexism,” and “cisphobia”
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions
- Communicating boundaries or criticizing oppressive behavior in a “tone” you don’t find congenial

The examples listed above are not against the Code of Conduct.

Outreach and diversity efforts directed at under-represented groups are permitted under the code of conduct. For example, a social event for women would not be classified as being outside the Code of Conduct under this provision.

Basic expectations for conduct are not covered by the “reverse-ism clause” and would be enforced irrespective of the demographics of those involved. For example, racial discrimination will not be tolerated, irrespective of the race of those involved. Nor would unwanted sexual attention be tolerated, whatever someone’s gender or sexual orientation. Members of our community have the right to expect that participants in the project will uphold these standards.
