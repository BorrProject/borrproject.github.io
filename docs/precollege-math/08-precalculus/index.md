*Timeline: 219 hours (videos: 73 hours, homework: ~146 hours)*

**Topics covered**:
`polynomial long division`
`synthetic division`
`rational functions`
`nonlinear inequalities`
`conic sections`
`sequences`
`series`
`probability`
`binomial theorem`
`polar coordinates`
`symmetric functions`

`and more`

This course is a mix between [The College Prep School](https://www.youtube.com/@thecollegeprepschool4486) and [Greene Math](https://greenemath.com/). Most of this course is contained in the following YouTube playlist, including your homework and tests. After completing the playlist you'll need to complete every topic on Greene Math under the [Matrices](https://greenemath.com/Precalculus.html#matrices-determinants) and [Vectors](https://greenemath.com/Precalculus.html#vectors) section. Note that "Precalculus" is also known as "Math Analysis".

**Course Playlist:** [TCPS - Precalculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm2VEQtiYjhrrznuk1nQu9qJBniirGXl_)

**Basic Linear Algebra:**
1. [Greene Math - Matricies & Determinants](https://greenemath.com/Precalculus.html#matrices-determinants)
2. [Greene Math - Vectors](https://greenemath.com/Precalculus.html#vectors)

## Instructions:

- Work through the playlist from top to bottom.
- In each video, the teacher works through a problem set, then a homework.
- When the teacher says "try this one on your own", pause the video and work it out. You do not have to do every single problem, but make sure to pay attention, learn the method to solve it, and do the ones he tells you to complete.
- Always complete the homework. If you get something wrong according to the answer key, try to see what you did wrong and redo the problem correctly.
- When you get to a review day, attempt every problem yourself then complete the homework.
- Take the tests seriously and don't cheat. Use them as a measure to see where your knowlege is at. Do not move on without feeling proficient at a topic.
- You may find a calculator useful for this course. [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) is a good free graphing calculator.
- When you get to Basic Linear Algebra, complete everything under the [Matrices](https://greenemath.com/Precalculus.html#matrices-determinants) and [Vectors](https://greenemath.com/Precalculus.html#vectors) section on [Greene Math](https://greenemath.com/). That includes all the readings, videos, practice exams, and unit tests in each topic. When you're finished, you are done with Pre-College Math. Congratulations!

## Supplemental Resources
- [Khan Academy - Precalculus](https://khanacademy.org/math/precalculus): This serves as a good tutor if you want a different perspective.
- [The Organic Chemistry Tutor - Precalculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0o_zxa4K1BU5sTWZ2YxFhpXwsnMfMke7): Another excellent tutor, if you have a struggle with a particular subject, search the topic + TheOrganicChemistryTutor for results.
- [Professor Leonard - Precalculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c41QejoWnb4&list=PLDesaqWTN6ESsmwELdrzhcGiRhk5DjwLP): This playlist contains his College Algebra & Trigonometry course combined. His College Algebra course is the first 73 episodes and roughly corresponds with this Precalculus course. Students who prefer a teacher + whiteboard teaching style may continue with this course.
- [OpenStax - Algebra & Trigonometry Textbook](https://openstax.org/details/books/intermediate-algebra-2e): Since many students learn better with a textbook, this is a good option.
    - [Scalar Learning - OpenStax - Algebra & Trigonometry](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZBnAG03572riK3KtGrTnpGNGn2fi-zDm): Full worked out solution playlist for the Algebra & Trigonometry Textbook
- [Greene Math - Precalculus](https://www.greenemath.com/Precalculus.html): Another good resource for Precalculus. Towards the end, it goes into Trigonometry, but that was covered in the last class.
