# Object-Oriented Design

CS 3500 teaches a rigorous approach to object-oriented programming and design, with an emphasis on abstraction, modularity, and code reuse as applied to the building and understanding of large-scale systems. We will explore the basic mechanisms and concepts of object-oriented programming: object, class, message, method, interface, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance. Students will gain hands-on experience with tools and techniques that facilitate the creation and maintenance of applications using the Java programming language.

This course assumes familiarity with programming in the style of *[Systematic Program Design](../spd)*, and basic knowledge of the Java programming language as introduced in *[Class-Based Program Design](../class-based/)*.
