# Electives

*Timeline: varies per student*

After completing **every required course** in Core CS, students should choose a subset of courses from Advanced CS based on interest.
Not every course from a subcategory needs to be taken.
But students should take *every* course that is relevant to the field they intend to go into.

#### Advanced programming

**Topics covered**:
`debugging theory and practice`
`goal-oriented programming`
`parallel computing`
`object-oriented analysis and design`
`UML`
`large-scale software architecture and design`
`and more`
