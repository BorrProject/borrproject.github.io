**Course Playlist:** [TCPS - Arithmetic](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm2VEQtiYjhpTTgxTVCXVcpYWDUqiewiQ)

## Instructions:

- Work through the playlist from top to bottom.
- In each video, the teacher works through a problem set, then a homework.
- When the teacher says "try this one on your own", pause the video and work it out. You do not have to do every single problem, but make sure to pay attention, learn the method to solve it, and do the ones he tells you to complete.
- Always complete the homework. If you get something wrong according to the answer key, try to see what you did wrong and redo the problem correctly.
- When you get to a review day, attempt every problem yourself then complete the homework.
- Take the tests seriously and don't cheat. Use them as a measure to see where your knowlege is at. Do not move on without feeling proficient at a topic.
- You shouldn't need a calculator for this course. Focus on manually doing each problem so that you remember the methods for doing so.

## Notes:

- [Class 5 - Memorizing Products](https://youtu.be/i219Ow_BZTI): A useful website to help you memorize your addition & multiplication facts is [XtraMath](https://home.xtramath.org/).

## Supplemental Resources:
- [Khan Academy - Arithmetic](https://khanacademy.org/math/arithmetic): This serves as a good tutor if you want a different perspective.
- [Math Antics](https://www.youtube.com/@mathantics/playlists): This channel has some good videos for Arithmetic & Pre-Algebra
- [Professor Leonard - Prealgebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4C9296DF81B9EF13): The first few videos touch on Arithmetic, however most of it is Pre-Algebra. It's good if you prefer a conversational teacher + whiteboard teaching style.
- [OpenStax - Prealgebra Textbook](https://openstax.org/details/books/prealgebra-2e): Just like Professor Leonard, this touches on basic Arithmetic, then moves onto Pre-Algebra realtively quickly. However, many students learn better with a textbook. This is a good option.
- [Greene Math - Pre-Algebra](https://www.greenemath.com/Prealgebra.html): Another good resource for Arithmetic & Pre-Algebra.
