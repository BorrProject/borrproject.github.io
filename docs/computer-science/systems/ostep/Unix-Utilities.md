### Hints
- This project is meant as a litmus-test for your proficiency at programming in C. It covers the very basics of being able to write useful programs. If you're struggling with this assignment, it may be a sign for you to take a step back, and get some more experience with C, as things will only get harder from here on out.
- If you still feel you need more C practice after completing this project, we recommend doing the [intial reverse](https://github.com/luccaflower/ostep-projects/tree/master/initial-reverse) project. But be mindful: The error messages that are needed to pass the tests are wrong! The provided text say `"error: ..."` but the tests expect `"reverse: ..."` so make sure to match the tests' expectations in your code.
